`lh-vim-lib`
------------

Mirror of Luc Hermitte's [`lh-vim-lib`][].

Created mostly to facilitate use with [vim-addon-manager][];
see [issue 35][] for details.

This library is a dependency of the [`UT`][] addon.

The mirror was created simply by using `git-svn`.

There is no guarantee that it will be kept updated.
